Abstract

Many students and working professionals staying in PGs and rented houses struggle with daily cooking due to busy schedules and limited cooking resources. This project aims to develop a web-based food service platform that connects users with cooks who can either cook at the user's place, provide takeaway meals from their own place, or be hired for special events. The system will have three user roles: Admin, Cooks, and Users. The platform will allow users to register, book services, and make payments online, while cooks can manage orders and availability. The admin will oversee the entire system, ensuring smooth operation.
